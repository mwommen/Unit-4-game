# Unit-4-game
jQuery Assignment

In this assignement I will be creating a guessing game. In this Game I need to make four crystals that are assigned a random value.

To win the game your score has to === the number to guess. If the userTotal is higher than the number to guess then the game will restart. When the game restarts all buttons will be given a new value as well as the number to guess will change. 

The values of the four buttons have to be hidden. 

If you match the number to guess, increase wins by one. 
if your score does not equate and goes above the number to guess, add a loss and restart game.
